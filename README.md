# Project Name: Gadget-Zone
Gadget-Zone is an e-commerce platform tailored for tech enthusiasts, specializing in a range of products including laptops, smartphones, smartwatches, and accessories. Built with React for efficient component-based design, the website utilizes React Router for seamless navigation and Tailwind CSS with DaisyUI for a responsive, visually appealing layout. The platform also includes a shopping cart, wishlist, and product filtering, with the Context API managing state across components. To enhance user experience, LocalStorage is implemented for data persistence, ensuring users can continue where they left off even after reloading the page.
